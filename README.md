# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts

This project is an analysis of the Hacker News Posts. The aim of the project was to analyze whether at a certain time of the day posts that begin with either "Ask HN" or "Show HN" posts gain more comments.

Few things to explore on are as follows:
Do show or ask posts receive more points on average?
Do posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points?
Compare my results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
